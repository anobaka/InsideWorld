/**
 * Says, and keeps saying, that the two halves are not the same version.
 *
 * The protocol handshake refuses a pair that cannot talk at all. This is the other case:
 * they can talk, and one of them is missing something the other knows about — most often
 * a user-side endpoint the client has not learned, which otherwise appears as "this needs
 * a newer client" at the moment somebody tries to use the feature. Told beforehand, that
 * error has an explanation; told nowhere, it reads as a bug.
 *
 * Deliberately not a toast and not dismissable: a mismatch does not stop being true
 * because it was acknowledged once, and the thing it explains may not be hit for days.
 * It is quiet instead — one line, no buttons, the same shape as the update banner beside
 * it, and gone the moment the versions match.
