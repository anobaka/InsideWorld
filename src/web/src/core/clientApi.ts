 * swagger and these endpoints are not the server's — they exist only in the client
 * process, answering questions about this machine. The enums below still come from
 * `constants.ts`: the codegen driver sees both sides and emits them, so the one thing
 * that could silently drift does not.
 *
 * Every call here is served by the forwarding layer on this origin. In any other
 * flavour they simply do not exist, which is why the pages that use them are shown
 * only when `clientMode` says PureClient.
