    ///
    /// 1. <em>Is this task already done?</em> A SingleWork task that has downloaded its torrent
    ///    leaves the file on disk, and the downloader's own first act is to notice that and return.
    ///    Reaching that point costs a downloader, a background task, a database write, a UI push and
    ///    a detail-page request paced a second behind the last one — for a task with nothing to do.
    ///    Across a re-run of a thousand mostly-finished tasks that is the entire run. Here it is one
    ///    directory listing per download folder, shared by every task in it.
    ///
    /// 2. <em>Will this task download images rather than a torrent?</em> Those go last under
    ///    torrent-priority. Unchanged in meaning from the per-task check it replaces — it is the same
    ///    predicate, asked once for the set instead of once per scheduling pass per task.
    ///
    /// Read-only by contract: it never probes the network and never writes. Anything it cannot settle
    /// locally stays <see cref="DownloadTaskPrecheckOutcome.Run"/> and the downloader decides.
