/// Nothing downstream catches it, and both ways it lands are bad. With no server attached
/// the listener answers the connect page, so the handshake reads HTML and reports "not a

/// the user needs told is that they gave it this client's address. With a server already
/// attached it is worse: the forwarder relays <c>/remote-access/server-info</c> upstream,

/// against that would point this client at itself, and every request afterwards would
/// loop back through the forwarder until the process ran out of something.
