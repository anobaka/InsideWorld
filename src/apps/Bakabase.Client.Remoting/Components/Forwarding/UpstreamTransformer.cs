/// <para>
/// Signing happens here rather than in a message handler because the signature covers
/// the path and query, and a message handler runs after YARP has already decided them.
/// Signing earlier would sign a URL that no longer matches what goes on the wire.

/// <para>
/// Which makes the order below load-bearing, and it is the opposite of what it looks
/// like: YARP fills <see cref="HttpRequestMessage.RequestUri"/> in <em>after</em> the
/// transformer returns, and only if it is still null. So a transformer that signs
/// without building the address first is handed a request with no URI at all — and the
/// signer, correctly, refuses to sign one. That threw inside YARP, which reported it as
/// a failure to create the request, which the forwarder reported as "the server is not
/// answering": a client that had just paired successfully answered every single request
/// with a 503 naming a server that was fine.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Anything the caller sent as <c>Authorization</c> is dropped first. A page in the
/// user's browser can put whatever it likes in that header, and forwarding it would let
/// it choose which device the server thinks is calling.
