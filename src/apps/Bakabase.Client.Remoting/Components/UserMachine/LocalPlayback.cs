/// Three routes play something — one named item, a whole resource, a random one — and
/// they differ only in how they work out what to play. Everything after that is the same
/// decision, and it is the part with the sharp edges: which player, a real path or a
/// stream, and never running an executable this machine did not recognise.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The interesting case is a local file, and it has two ways to reach a player. If the
/// user has mapped that library, the player gets the real path and reads from disk —
/// fast, seekable, no server involved once it starts. If they have not, the player gets a
/// URL through this client's own forwarding layer instead, which signs and relays it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// That fallback is the difference between "set up a path mapping first" and "it plays".
/// Streaming is worse than local disk, so mapping is still worth doing and the settings
/// page says so — but nothing has to be configured before the first video plays, and a
/// library that genuinely is not on this machine works at all.
