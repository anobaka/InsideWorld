/// Every other check in the gate is per-request: an HTTP call from a revoked device is
/// refused the next time it is made, because the authenticator looks the device up each
/// time. A hub connection is the exception — it is authorized once, at the handshake,
/// and then keeps receiving pushes (options among them) for as long as it stays open.
/// So revoking a device, or closing the door on unpaired ones, has to reach back into
/// connections that are already established.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Loopback connections are never tracked, which is what keeps the all-in-one out of
/// this entirely: on a desktop install this registry stays empty, and nothing here can
/// hang up on the app's own UI.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Holds an abort callback rather than SignalR's connection context, so every rule about
/// who gets dropped is decidable without a hub.
