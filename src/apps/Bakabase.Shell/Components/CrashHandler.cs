/// Last-resort reporting for exceptions that nothing else catches.
///
/// <c>AppHost.Start</c> already wraps its own body in a try/catch that logs and raises the
/// fatal-error window, so anything failing in there is both visible and recorded. The window
/// before it is neither: a throw in Avalonia's XAML load, in <c>App.Initialize</c>'s tray-icon
/// resolution, in the pending data-path relocation, or in <c>AppService</c>'s static
/// constructor ends the process with no window and no log line. That is precisely the "it
/// closes the instant I open it" report we cannot act on — the exception exists only in the
/// OS event log, which users do not think to open and we cannot walk every one of them
/// through.
///
/// Sentry is deliberately not called from here. <c>SentrySdk.Init</c> (see
/// <c>BakabaseStartup.ConfigureServices</c>) installs its own unhandled-exception integration,
/// so capturing again would duplicate every event it can already see; and before that init
/// runs there is no transport to send on anyway. What this class adds is the two sinks Sentry
/// cannot cover: the file log, and stderr.
